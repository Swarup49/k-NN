# k-NN
This repository contains a Python script demonstrating k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification using OpenCV and visualizing the results with Matplotlib.

## Overview

The script generates random training data points with corresponding labels (0 or 1), plots them on a scatter plot using Matplotlib, and then performs KNN classification on a randomly generated newcomer point. The red and blue points represent the training data, and the green point represents the newcomer. The script uses OpenCV's `cv.ml.KNearest` for KNN classification.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
